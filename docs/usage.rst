Usage

Creating a handler
------------------

To manipulate resources (Users, Wallets, etc.) from this api you will have to
instanciate a new handler which is basically a connection authentification.

To create a new handler, you have to provide several parameters.

``API_PARTNER_ID``
..................

This is the partner identifier used by mangopay_ to identify you.

``API_PRIVATE_KEY``
...................

This is the certificat used in each requests.

``API_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD``
............................

This is the password linked to the certificat.

``API_HOST``
............

The host used to call the API. We will see later
when you are creating a new handler you can choose between
multiple environment hosts already registered.

Let's get to work, we will create our first handler with the sandbox host ::

    client_id = 'dummy'
    passphrase = '$ecret'

    from mangopay.api import MangopayAPI

    handler = MangopayAPI(client_id,
                          passphrase,
                          sandbox=True)

Now we have a new handler which is using the `sandbox host`_.

If you are not specifying that you are using the `sandbox host`_
nor an existing host, it will use the `production host`_.

Specific host for mangopay_ endpoint ::

    handler = MangopayAPI(client_id,
                          passphrase,
                          host='http://dummy.api.prod.mangopay.com')

Using resources
---------------

To manipulate resources, this library is heavily inspired from peewee_,
so every operations will be like manipulating a ORM.
In fact, python-mangopay is a port of python-leetchi

For required parameters you have to refer to the `reference api`_.

Users
.....

Creating a new naturla user ::

    from mangopay.resources import NaturalUser
    from datetime import date
    user = NaturalUser(first_name='Stephane',
                       last_name='Planquart',
                       email='stephane@test.test',
                       ip_address='127.0.0.1',
                       nationality='FR',
                       birthday=date.today(),
                       country_of_residence='fr')

    user.save(handler) # save the new user

    print user.get_pk() # retrieve the primary key

Retrieving an existing user ::

    user = NaturalUser.get(1)

    print user.first_name # Stephane

Detecting user that does not exist ::

    try:
        user = NaturalUser.get(2, handler)
    except NaturalUser.DoesNotExist:
        print 'The user 2 does not exist'

Wallets
.......

Affecting a wallet to an existing user ::

    user = NaturalUser.get(1, handler)

    from mangopay.resources import Wallet

    wallet = Wallet(tag='wallet for user n.1',
                    name='Florent Messa wallet',
                    description='A new wallet for Florent Messa',
                    raising_goal_amount=1200,
                    users=[user])
    wallet.save(handler) # save the new wallet

    print wallet.get_pk() # 1

Retrieving all wallets for an existing user ::

    user = User.get(1, handler)

    wallet_list = user.wallet_set

By default all amount are in centimes but this library provides
an helper to quickly convert an amount to a readable one ::

    print wallet.raising_goal_amount # 1200
    print wallet.raising_goal_amount_converted # 12.00

Contributions
.............

A contribution a the only way to put money on a wallet,
with the `mangopay`_ API you can also put money a user wallet.

Creating a new contribution for a dedicated wallet ::

    from leetchi.resources import Contribution, Wallet, User

    user = User.get(1, handler)
    wallet = Wallet.get(1, handler)

    contribution = Contribution(user=user,
                                wallet=wallet,
                                amount=1000,
                                return_url='http://my-website/back-url',
                                client_fee_amount=0)
    contribution.save(handler)

    print contribution.is_success() # False
    print contribution.is_succeeded # False
    print contribution.is_completed # False

Creating a new contribution for a personal wallet ::

    contribution = Contribution(user=user,
                                wallet_id=0,
                                amount=1000,
                                return_url='http://my-website/back-url',
                                client_fee_amount=0)
    contribution.save(handler)

Transfers
.........

Creating a transfer from a personal wallet to another wallet ::

    from leetchi.resources import User, Transfer, Wallet

    user = User.get(1, handler)

    beneficiary = User.get(2, handler)

    beneficiary_wallet = Wallet.get(2, handler)

    transfer = Transfer(payer=user,
                        beneficiary=beneficiary,
                        payer_wallet_id=0,
                        beneficiary_wallet=beneficiary_wallet,
                        amount=1000)
    transfer.save(handler)

    print transfer.get_pk() # 1

    beneficiary_wallet = Wallet.get(2, handler)

    print beneficiary_wallet.collected_amount # 1000

Transfer refunds
................

If you want to cancel a transfer and move back the money
from one wallet to another ::

    from leetchi.resources import TransferRefund, Transfer, User

    user = User.get(1, handler)
    transfer = Transfer.get(1, handler)

    transfer_refund = TransferRefund(user=user, transfer=transfer)

    wallet = transfer.beneficiary_wallet

    print wallet.collected_amount # 1000
    print wallet.remaining_amount # 0

    print user.personal_wallet_amount # 1000

Refunds
.......

If you want to refund a contribution and move back the money from
a wallet to a credit card account ::

    from leetchi.resources import Contribution, User, Refund

    user = User.get(1, handler)
    contribution = Contribution.get(1, handler)

    refund = Refund(contribution=contribution,
                    user=user)
    refund.save(handler)

Operations
..........

Retrieving all operations for a dedicated user ::

    from leetchi.resources import User

    user = User.get(1, handler)

    operation_list = user.operation_set
